# IDL to XQuery

A java application to generate XQuery compatible client and server stubs for CORBA IDL service definitions.

It is anticipated that a future method for invoking this XQuery code be devised - either internal to MarkLogic
or external via an API (then the REST API). This work is out of scope for this project. This project is just
trying to provide an idl2xquery parser that generates XQuery stubs for CORBA IDL files.
